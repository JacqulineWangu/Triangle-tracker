  <p>A triangle is a closed figure made up of three line segments.</p>

  <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.</p>
  <p>It is one of the basic shapes in geometry.</p>
  <p>A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><em><strong>Equilateral triangles</strong></em> are triangles in which all three sides are the same length.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Isosceles triangles</strong></em> are triangles in which two of the sides are the same length.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Scalene triangles</strong></em> are triangles in which none of the sides are the same length.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1><strong>PROPERTIES OF A TRIANGLE</strong></h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A triangle has three sides</li>
    <li>The interior angles of a triangle always add up to 180°</li>
    <li>The exterior angles of a triangle always add up to 360°</li>
    <p>And of the <strong>trilateral figures</strong>: an <strong>equilateral triangle</strong> is that having three equal sides, an <strong>isosceles</strong> (triangle) that having only two equal sides, and a <strong>scalene</strong> (triangle)
      that having three unequal sides.</p>
